**Abstract** This paper studies how the allocation of managerial talent both between and within firms affects firm composition, dynamics, and the broader distribution of productivity across the economy. I build a firm dynamics model with frictional between-firm allocation and costly within-firm promotion of managers and derive the equilibrium implications of these forces to firm composition and aggregate productivity distribution. Using granular German employer-employee data, I analyze and quantify the impact of these channels on managerial position flows. Theoretical insights are confronted with empirical evidence to assess their implications for firm dynamics and overall productivity.
