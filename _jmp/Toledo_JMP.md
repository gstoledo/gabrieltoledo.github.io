**Abstract** This paper studies how the allocative choices of managerial talent between and within a firm affect firm composition decisions, its dynamics and ultimately the economy-wide distribution of firm productivity. I build a firm dynamics model with frictional between-firm allocation and costly within-firm promotion of managers and derive the equilibrium implications of these forces to firm composition and aggregate productivity distribution. Using German employer-employee level data, I document and disentangle the impact of these forces on the flows of granular-level manager positions. I confront theory and data to quantify these forces and their implications for firm dynamics and aggregate productivity.
