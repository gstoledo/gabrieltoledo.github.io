**Abstract** We develop a model of search in OTC markets with asymmetric information and trade occur-
ring under double-sided uncertainty over asset quality, where holding the asset does not necessarily
translate into knowing its quality. This leads to deterioration of market information conditions over
subsequent trades, causing both sellers and buyers to become more pessimistic even though ag-
gregate asset quality remains unchanged. If re-trade opportunities are frequent, information in the
economy becomes coarser, hindering market liquidity and volume of trade.
